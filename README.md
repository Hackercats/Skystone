The only surviving bits of block code used in the 2019-2020 season.

These programs are as of December 8th 2019, and our last qualifier was December 15th, so a little bit changed.
We also used blocks in our rookie season, Rover Ruckus, but no files survive.

The .blk files can be opened by importing them into the ftc blocks programming interface.
